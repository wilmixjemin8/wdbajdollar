It   saves  time   and  cost \r\n\r\n   2.It   Provides   very high  security with  encryption\r\n\r\n   3. It   is   a   remote database\r\n\r\n   4.it  is  used   in cloud  computing\r\n\r\n   5.it  is  used in    banking  and  insurance projects  and  with all\r\nWSIT  Technologies.\r\n\r\n   6.it  provides   encryption ,  deencryption ,etc\r\n\r\n   7.It  is  flexible, user friendly,  robot  ,  and fast.\r\n\r\n   8.We  can write  only   single  piece   of \r\n      code  to        connect    to  database.\r\n\r\n   9. It  is  also  a  interactive    database.\r\n\r\n   10. It  is  used     to  store   data    to  - from  any  database.\r\n\r\n   11. we  can also   store  large   bulks  of  data  and set   the relationship  between  the\r\n  table.\r\n\r\n   12.  It   is  a  platform  independant    database.\r\n\r\n   13. It   stores  the  data  in a  serialization   format.\r\n\r\n   14.  WDBAJ$  is  a  NO-SQL  Database\r\n\r\n   15. We  can  also    executed   encrypted class file\r\n  .dbs  file and  it   will   generate  a  output.\r\n \r\n   16.   WDBAJ$   is used  with  Oracle or MYSQL Server .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNTAX\r\n=======\r\n\r\n\r\n<WDBA>\r\n\r\n<Convert>\r\n\r\n<DATA>\r\n\r\n<!
